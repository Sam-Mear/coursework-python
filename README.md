# A-Level Coursework - CSGO Stats
Scrapes HLTV for data(Though this does not work anymore, due to updates on hltv.org) and displays it.

This readme to be updated after I find my A-Level document.

This has been updated only to show the data in it, and not most recent data, so that it works and doesnt display anything.

It has been tested on python 3.11

## Prerequisite
* tkinter
* bs4 if u want to try the scraper
